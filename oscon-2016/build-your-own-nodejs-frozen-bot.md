# Build your child their very own Node.js Frozen bot

# Details:
* http://conferences.oreilly.com/oscon/open-source-us/public/schedule/detail/49289
* Gabrielle Crevecoeur (Microsoft)

# Notes:
*	Don't learn about robotics in CS or microcontrollers
*	NodeBot http://nodebots.io/
*	Going to create voice activated nodebot
	*	- sister has been Elsa for halloween for 3 years
*	hardware:  Rasp Pi vs Arduino  (Intel edison)
	*	Rasp Pi = microcomputer  give monitor, keyboard, mouse, could use windows iot core (raspian)
	*	Arduino - smaller, microcontroller.  Download Arduino IDE and create sketch and push to arduino.
	*	Do I want complicated or easy?
	*	Difficult to change config on RPi
*	JohnnyFive uses NodeJS to talk to different boards.  
	*	download from NPM.  Can connect to arduino
*	Lots of RPi is in Python
*	LED Blinking is Hello World or Arduino
*	get leds in experimental kit.
*	"Not an Elec Eng:  but you put in 13 and ground and it shoots energy through it."
*	Need:
	*	Hardwre:  arduino, shield, speaker
	*	arduino libraries needed (Sparkfun)
	*	node modules
*	Interchange Arduino Library
*	Listens and send data to Azure speech to Text and looks for keywords 
*	Microsoft Cognitive services
*	aka.ms/frozenbot
	*	Jesse instead of Wheezy for RPi
*	Frimata Protocol (there is one for Arduino, and one for SparkIO)
