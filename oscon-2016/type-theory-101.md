## Notes:
*	connecting algebra/calculus with logic
*	logic is the science of argument
*	Write aguments that can be checked mechanically
	*	study properties
	*	elaborate semantic meanings
	*	propositional and predicate logic
*	sometimes the imperative mode of writing code won't help at all
*	Functional programming!
	*	high order functions
	*	monoids
	*	monads
	*	functors
*	"How can you get oscon pants"
	*	"attendee 20 tokens -> 
	*	Speaker f(change) pants
*	Speaker + f(change) => attendee => f(change) => pants
	*	High order function
*	imagine team of 
	* Person with 0 badges is identity element
	*	reduce; itentity element; collections
*	reduce + 0{100 100 100 100 100]) ;; => 500 = monoid	
*	it is important that structure is maintained
*	get element, apply a function if convenient, flatten and guarantee same type of output.  allow for chained calls
	*	=> MONADS!
*	same way to apply algebra to numbers, can apply type of calculation in our FP structures

*	Must understand Maths
*	1.) choose a lang that allows pure FP  (haskell, idris, ocaml)
