# OSCon 2016

I am grateful that Yahoo allowed me to go to this Open Source Event so that I could learn more about software development practices in the Open Source space as well as do research for a project I'm currently working on:  Network Asset Discovery Database System

I attended 2 days of Tutorials (3.5 hours each) and 2 days of Sessions.

I bounced around some of the sessions, so they might not be as well defined and eloquent.  Keep in mind I'm trying to take notes as well as retain the information from the event.
