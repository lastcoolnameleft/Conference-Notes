# Notes:
*	http://andy.kitchen/oscon/#/
*	Machine learning for humans
*	"any signficant tech...magic"
*	cutting edge tech is just a little big magical
*	statistics is about noise (feed of weather data and want to make prediction)
	*	only marginally related, so trying to cut out noise
*	machine learning is about structure
	*	about learning complicated structure
*	AI is about consciousness
* neuron.  want to turn on when we see a cat.
	*	cat -> pointy ears
		*	-> button noise
		*	->  slobber (?? evidence it's not a cat)
*	pattern recognition
	*	crystalized information (if bus leaves at 4pm tomorrow, I can assume structure)
	*	a gap between possible entropy and realized entropy
*	two lights blinking.  major entropy.  but if we say both blink together, we can asssume
	* "the turn"
	*	magician takes somethign ordinary and makes it seem extraordinary

*	Server:
	*	TensorFlow
* Space invaders:  
	*	input:  picture of the screen
	*	to make human-like, only changes every 4 frames
	*	single minded to make score go up.  
	*	only reason it doesn't want to die is because it learned it stops scoring
	  *	life lesson!
	
# Q&A:
*	I want to teach computer to play tictactoe. how do i get there?
	*	free book:  reinforcement learning  "TTT algo"
*	re-inforcment learning is new thing
	*	cto of deep mind "david silver"
* thoguhts on general intelligence and if/when we will get there.
		"20 years"
