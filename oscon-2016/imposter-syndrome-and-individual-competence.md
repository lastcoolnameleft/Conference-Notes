_Personal Note:  This was one of my favorite talks because it talked about the human side of software development._

# Notes:
* DreamFactory
* We think: "that person is not freaking out, they must be doing somethign right"
* "We are ghosts driving a meat costume"
* Zone of Proximial Development:  idea that if working on taks beyond your real level, you are not learning anything.
	*	similar to grinding in rpg.
	* or working on tasks far too difficult, still not learning.  going to do seious damage to motivation
	* ZPD is sweet spot to be happy.
	* to be there, need to self-assest current 
	* your brain is horrible at that.  brain has no idea what your skill level is.
* cognitive bias:
	*	brain using bad data to build worse conclustions that it becomes really attached to. --her husband
* imposter syndrome:
	*	feeling that everyone else knows what they're doing, and 
	*	feeling that you have no idea what you're doing and your peers are fine.
	*	"you are faking it"
* what does IS do
	*	feeling of inadequacy
	*	avoid displaying target skils
	*	use charm, social mitigation.  (got better at soft skills)
	*	increased attention to area they were interested int.  they worked harder when they didn't feel good enough
*	who is impacted?
	*	high achieving women often impacted
		*	and women of color
		*	visible minorities
* I feel horrible, I feel terrible.
	* easy in our culture for women to say "I feel". 
* if you don't see yourself in lived experiences, you feel alone
	* imposter syndrome is internal feeling, but not paying attention to message
	* people are getting messages "you don't belong here, this is not your space, you do not belong here"
		* doubts are compounded.
* can't fix cognative bias.  but can change way impact us.
		* making it better for others
* DO NOT tell someone they have imposter syndrome
* DO create positive meaningful and actionable feedback
* I give happy packets.  
* "People are great.  But we dont' scale well"
* DO:  Talk about your own feeling and fears when you feel comfortable
* "I'm clearly fabulous , but sometimes I cry in the bath"
* Can't debug brain, but can get better data
* can't fix cognative bias, but can fix feedback loop
* Closing comptuer and "going away" will get out of feedback loop
* Recasting imposter syndrome
*	Increased dedication 
*	"Head can"  -- imagiging how things are. puppy soup?
*	Dunning and Kruger:  Do stupid people know they're stupid?
	*	"called unskilled"
	*	"terminially unskilled rated themselves high"
	*	closer you are to being really good at a thing, perceivied themself lower
* unskilled 
	*	aren't aware of their lack of skill
	*	are unable to access and value other ski
	*	can only move past if they recognize their own lack of skill
*	brain is giving really crappy error message.
*	don't think of yourself as an imposter, but instead as biggest con artist as possible
*	"by telling yourself that, you're really saying you're not one of the unskilled"
*	if you're in a community and you're not supported: LEAVE
*	How to not downward spiral:   "Timeout" "I need to go to the bathroom"
*	Hire in group, give them ownership of something
	*	Welcome for joining, you now are in charge of X. How can we support you?
